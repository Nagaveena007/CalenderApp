        --------------- CALENDAR'S FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS ---------------  -> ANALYSIS
        - show the days of the month
        - user can click on a date to select it
        - user should be able to provide some information about a meeting, and create that new meeting accordingly
        - we should display all the saved meetings for the selected day
        - meeting details cover time and description
        - the selected day should be highlighted somehow
        - keep track of the saved meetings when we select other days
        -- NICE TO HAVE
        - show a visual hint on days that have assigned meetings
        - persist meeting data, so we won't lose that when refreshing the page
        - delete a saved meeting
        - edit a saved meeting
        - displaying the current month (with the appropriate number of days and the name of the month in the header)
        - being able to switch among several months/years
        - why the heck are we expected to display 5 days per row?
        - should we display weekdays Sun to Sat or Mon to Sun?
        - show public holidays
        --------------- THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO IMPLEMENT ---------------  -> DESIGN
        -- HTML ELEMENTS
        - a container for the entire month
        -- the days of the month
        - page title
        - a container for the meeting creation controls
        -- meeting creation button
        -- controls for collecting meeting time and description
        -- a title for the section itself
        - a container to display the meetings currently assigned to the selected day
        -- CSS STYLES
        - generic day
        - selected day
        - inputs
        - general font face and color
        - meetings
        -- NICE TO HAVE
        - day hover
        - public holidays
        - day with assigned meetings
        -- FUNCTIONS
        - select a day (when the user clicks on that)
        - create a meeting based on user provided information
        - display assigned meetings for the selected day
        - keep track of saved meetings
        - create days dynamically
        -- NICE TO HAVE
        - persist saved meetings to the disk, and load them as soon as we load the page
        - change visual appearance of days that have assigned meetings
        - delete a meeting
        - edit a meeting
        - switch to a different month
